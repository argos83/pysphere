PySphere 
========
Python API for interacting with the vSphere Web Services SDK.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Visit the project_ site for more information.

.. _project: http://pysphere.googlecode.com

**Among other operations, this api allows the user to:**

- Connect to VMWare's ESX, ESXi, Virtual Center, Virtual Server hosts 
- Query hosts, datacenters, resource pools, virtual machines
- VMs: Power on, power off, reset, revert to snapshot, get properties, update 
  vmware tools
- vSphere 5.0 Guest Operations: create/delete/move files and directories.
  upload/download files from the guest system. List/start/stop processes in 
  the guest system.
- Create and delete snapshots
- Get hosts statistics and monitor performance

It's built upon a slightly modified version of ZSI_ (that comes bundled-in) 
which makes it really fast in contrast to other python SOAP libraries that don't
provide code generation.

1. Unzip the package
2. run: ``python setup.py install``

Quick Example
-------------

Here's how you power on a virtual machine. See also the `getting started`_ guide
and the project's wiki_ with the full documentation.

.. _getting started: http://code.google.com/p/pysphere/wiki/GettingStarted
.. _wiki: http://code.google.com/p/pysphere/w/list

>>> from pysphere import VIServer
>>> server = VIServer()
>>> server.connect("my.esx.host.com", "myusername", "secret")
>>> vm = server.get_vm_by_path("[datastore] path/to/file.vmx")
>>> vm.power_on()
>>> print vm.get_status()
POWERED ON
